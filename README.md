## 1. Introduction

  * [1.1 Project Motivation](#11-project-motivation)
  * [1.2 Project Aim](#12-project-aim)

### 1.1 Project Motivation 

With the deluge of beauty products in the market today, many are overwhelmed by the choices available. They often have no idea which product they should buy, and more often than not, they end up buying whatever insidious advertisements push them to. This leads to overconsumption of ill-suited beauty products, which will eventually be left to expire in a corner of their vanities. Also, many beauty products require consistent application for optimal results, but with their busy lives they forget steps in their beauty routines and may even end up skipping it entirely.

Furthermore, it is difficult to find people around them who use the same type of beauty products as them. This makes it challenging when they want to discuss specific beauty issues or discover the latest trending product. 

### 1.2 Project Aim 

We hope to solve beauty enthusiasts’ woes through an integrated web application. Leveraging on the experience and knowledge gathered through crowdsourcing, the community of beauty product users can optimise their purchase and use of beauty products. Our web application also serves as a tool to organise users’ many beauty products and visualise their beauty routines. Moreover, we hope to provide a platform for like-minded users to connect.

#### **2.2.8 Add Product to My Products**

This feature allows users to add a product to one of the categories in *My Products* (Shelved, Currently Using, or Wish List).

![add](https://i.imgur.com/ClXpY5i.png)

*How to access this feature*: 

Users can only add a product by searching for the product on the Search Products page. Users can click on the dropdown box in the second-rightmost column of the row for the product they wish to add, then select the category they wish to add this product to. (see below)

![addwhere](https://i.imgur.com/CnOyUbk.png)

*Function*:

* **Add a product to Shelved or Wish List**

Users can select the appropriate category (Shelved or Wish List) in the dropdown box, then click the *Add!* button at the side. Users will then be redirected to the corresponding My Products page (Shelved or Wish List) showing all the products the user has shelved or put into the user's wish list respectively.

* **Add a product to Currently Using**

Users can select Currently Using in the dropdown box, then click the *Add!* button at the side. Users will then be redirected to a page to fill up additional details for usage of the product, namely its expiry date, frequency of usage, and which beauty routine it should be in.

If the user indicates a weekly or monthly usage, the default number of times to use it would be once a week on Mondays / once a month on the 1st of each month respectively. 

If the user wishes to specify more detailed, personalised usage of the product, the user can fill up the optional fields. For instance, if one wishes to use the product twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, one would fill up the optional fields as such (see example below).

If the user wishes to use the product a certain number of times a week / month but has no preference for which specific days to use it on, the user can leave the *Specific days to use product* portion empty and our app will automatically allocate days to use the product on. 

![addcurrentlyusing](https://i.imgur.com/HZZnO9S.png)

After clicking the *Add to Currently Using* button at the bottom of the page, users will be redirected to the Currently Using page showing all the products the user is currently using.

Note:
* If the product the user wishes to add to *My Products* does not exist, the user has to create the product first, then add it to *My Products*.
* If the user indicates *n* times to use a product per week/month and specifies fewer than *n* specific days to use the product on, the display of the product in the beauty routine checklists on the Dashboard will follow the specified days. 
For example, if a user indicates a product to be used 3 times a week with specific days indicated as '1,3', the beauty routine checklists will only show the product on Mondays and Wednesdays.
